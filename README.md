KnightCode Compiler
The KnightCode Compiler is a Java-based compiler for the KnightCode programming language. It uses ANTLR to generate lexer and parser classes, and generates bytecode using ASM.


This project encapsulates the directory structure required for the final project in CS322. 
Created a compiler that works with the given language KnightCode.
myListener was created to complete necessary calculations using the BNF grammar given and ASM bytecode.
kcc is the main application where you can pass in a file and it produces an output file.
Variable class was created to store values into a hashmap easier. Each variable object has name, value/count, and type (INTEGER or STRING)
The writeFile is used as the bytearray.
